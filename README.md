# Multithreaded Network Communication System

This project demonstrates a comprehensive network communication system in Java, utilizing various threading models to handle client-server interactions. The project is divided into three implementations: single-threaded, multithreaded, and thread pool-based servers.

## Description
### SingleThreaded
Client.java: A basic client that connects to a server, sends a message, and receives a response.

Server.java: A simple server that handles one client connection at a time.

### Multithreaded
Client.java: Simulates multiple clients connecting to the server concurrently using threads.

Server.java: Handles each client connection in a separate thread, allowing simultaneous client interactions.

### ThreadPool
Server.java: Utilizes a fixed-size thread pool to manage client connections efficiently, improving scalability and resource management.

## Key Features
Socket Programming: Establishes TCP connections for reliable client-server communication.
Multithreading: Implements various threading models to handle multiple client connections.
Resource Management: Uses ExecutorService for efficient thread pooling, optimizing performance and scalability.
Concurrency Control: Demonstrates effective management of concurrent client interactions.
Exception Handling: Manages IO exceptions and ensures clean resource shutdown.

## Learning Outcomes
Understanding of different threading models and their impact on application performance.
Practical experience in handling network communication and multithreaded environments.
Enhanced problem-solving skills in designing and implementing robust client-server architectures.

## Future Enhancements
Refactor code for better readability and maintainability.
Use CMake for easier code compilation.
Improve data structure implementations for better performance.
Incorporate additional scheduling algorithms and data structures.
Enhance error handling for increased robustness.
